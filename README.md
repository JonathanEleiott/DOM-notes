# DOM - Document Object Model

- Made up of Nodes
- How we add functionality to an HTML page with JS

## DOM Selectors

- querySelector
  - grabs the first element that matches the css selector
  - single element

- querySelectorAll
  - grab all of the elements that match the css selector
  - array-like object (not exactly the same as a JS array)

## Events - a signal that something has occured in the browser

- how the user can interact with our website
  - button click
  - form submission
  - timer
  - page being loaded

## Event Listener - listens for an event to happen/trigger

- addEventListener - attach an event to handler

## Event Handler - a function that will run when an event occurs
